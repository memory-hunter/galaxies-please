# How To Play
In Galaxies, Please! you take on the role of a NASA Director. They have recently launched the new James Webb Space Telescope and because of how powerful it is, you can have a better understanding of the galaxy. However, the old data remains and it is someone's job to sort truth from old fiction, and that someone is you. In the game you receive documents with old data, pictures and information about galaxies and using the JWST, you can measure the truth and either accept or decline the documents in front of you.

## Rules

At start, you receive a certain amount of documents containing information about galaxies:

- Name
- Image
- Size
- Distance
- Constellation
- Type

Some data is correct, old or just plain wrong.  You can look through the JWST to see the truth and compare it to the document to accept or deny it.  If you make 3 mistakes, meaning accept a false document or reject a correct one, you get fired from NASA.  If you get through all documents with less than 3 mistakes you win.

## Controls

- Accept button: Accept the document as true
- Reject Button: Reject the document as false
- JWST button: See the picture of the galaxy in JWST
- Esc: Go back to main game screen when in JWST

## Goal

Your goal is to sort through the galaxy documents, sorting truth from falsehoods with less than 3 mistakes. In which case you win the game and advance human science another important step forward.
